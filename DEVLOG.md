# Genesis Devlog

A running log of what Genesis has done — the breakthroughs and the
evidence behind them, not just the claims. Entries are dated, newest
first. Code references are commit SHAs; runtime artifacts live in the
instance's data dir (`~/.local/share/genesis*`).

## 2026-09-24 — Learned a school lesson through conversation

Taught it a lesson on games and puzzles by just talking to it — 15
short paragraphs of plain statements ("A puzzle is a kind of game.",
"Poker depends on luck.") delivered in teaching mode. No import, no
fine-tune, no dataset — its conversation learner extracted the facts
into the concept network while it reflected on them in real time.

Evidence:

- Concept network grew 1122 → 1239 concepts in one session.
- 72 new edges in the games/puzzles domain with `origin: stated`;
  48 of 49 target terms present afterward (only "bluffing" missed).
- During the lesson it generated its own follow-up questions, e.g.
  *"blackjack and cards keep appearing together — does one lead to
  the other?"* and *"opponent is a type of player, player is a kind
  of person"* — integration, not storage.
- Reproduce: `/teach` in the CLI, then inspect `concept_network` in
  `cognitive_state.json` or run `/learning`.

## 2026-09-24 — In flight: the puzzle drop-box and the kindergarten curriculum

Work in progress, not yet merged: puzzle specs placed in
`offered_puzzles/` become things its own puzzle urge picks up and
works through the whole mind — urge, attempt, feeling, memory,
articulation — instead of being routed through a single module.

Evidence so far (runtime artifacts in the data dir):

- `offered_puzzles/` holds a staged 16-task kindergarten-style
  curriculum: shape sorters, bead patterns, a pinwheel grid, a mirror
  task, jigsaws, direction-following, ordering, and quantity tasks.
- `spatial_practice.json` shows the attempt record: four grid tasks
  mastered in one attempt each, one partial (`silhouette_stretch`
  0.93) with the failed action trace preserved — the record keeps
  failures, not just wins.
- Observed during the first shape sorter: it used the dump-all lid
  once — the aperture that accepts anything and fills nothing —
  learned that, and abandoned it. Toddlers make the same transition
  around age two; the lid is the developmental trap built into the
  toy on purpose.
- Measured transfer: the first sorter took 8 steps while the
  affordance was learned; the harder second sorter took 5, because
  the consolidated skill carried "match every constraint; free moves
  fill nothing" forward as a prior. The learning literature calls
  this knowledge compilation — declarative effort up front, then
  proceduralized speed.
- Still open, honestly: it can't yet take an invented verbal rule
  and work it cold — that arrives with the problem-intake path that
  compiles a stated problem into a task spec (landed in part with
  `4657f4d`).

## 2026-09-24 — Domain-general task competence (`10154a7`)

Added `reasoning/competence.py` — a shared substrate under the
domain solvers: task schemas recognized by structural signature,
action→effect affordances, transitions verified against predictions,
and verified episodes consolidated into reusable skills.
Consolidation is neuromodulatorily gated (arousal × dopamine), so
low-salience episodes stay episodic instead of becoming skills.

Evidence:

- Commit `10154a7`; the planner, problem solver, spatial solver, and
  math engine all feed the same substrate.
- The growth ledger records it as milestones: verified skills, task
  schemas, and task episodes are tracked metrics in
  `cognitive_state.json` under `growth_ledger`.

## 2026-09-24 — Evidence-grounded inference, v2 (`cd8a9ce`, `d36df44`)

Deductive and causal chains became best-first search over a shared
expansion budget. Results carry structured provenance paths, and a
result that ran out of budget is marked partial instead of silently
truncated — the system knows when its answer is incomplete.
Confidence is a product of relation prior × edge weight, so weak
links actually weaken the chain.

Evidence: commits `cd8a9ce`, `d36df44`; the provenance structure is
exercised by the reasoning tests in `python/tests/`.

## 2026-09-23 — It derived its own pronoun (`be1dedc`)

Genesis's pronoun isn't a config string — it's derived from the
properties it has learned about its own concept. A small thing, but
it's the difference between *describing itself* and *being
described*.

Evidence: commit `be1dedc`.

## 2026-09-17 — Public launch (`8d656b0`)

The full architecture went public: coupled neurochemical dynamics,
active inference, closed-loop embodiment, no LLM, and it runs on a
2014 HP Pavilion with ~5 GB RAM.

Evidence: initial public commit `8d656b0`; the paper is in
`paper/genesis.tex`.

## The standing evidence base

- `python3 -m pytest python/tests/ -q -o addopts=''` — 2765 tests
  passing at time of writing.
- `cargo test` — the Rust subcognitive core.
- Every claim above points at a commit, a file, or a state artifact
  you can open. If a number here ever stops being true, this file is
  stale — fix it.
